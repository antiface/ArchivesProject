Sustainability
==============
* THE IDEA IS THIS: If it is true that there will be a Great Maker Revolution, then like any other Business or Operation Since The Beginning of Time It Will Suffer From Some Of These Things Unless Someone Has a Plan of Some Kind:
* *The Art Operation will NOT be sustainable All on Its Own, Like Mystical-Ecstatic Joy or Magical Self-Deception Seems to Prove
* * A Master Plan will need to be developed for it to work, to be sustainable. It is either Sustainable or Not, and it has to have a Plan, or else it is A Sick Man's Dreams (Aeigri Somnia).

I am developing a Master Plan here that you can use to try to purposively Generate or Create The Maker Revolution Exactly As You Imagined it. I am assuming that it is possible to just Generate an Art Movement merely by Feeling One Into Existence. If my experiments prove successful, then it is not only possible to Predict the Future, but it is possible to Control the Global Population and make them Obey Your Commands.

Since I am NOT God or the King of Kings, I predict that it is impossible. I predict that There Is Not Maker Revolution. I predict that You Could Not Create One if you Wanted to. I can also predict that you DID NOT HAVE A PLAN IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER.. I can already prove this because I AM WRITING THE BEST PLAN I CAN THINK OF AS A PROFESSIONAL ARTIST WHO HAS PRACTISED HIS WHOLE LIFE AND IS RECOGNIZED BY HIS PEERS. Therefore, I either possess secret knowledge from some secret society that the secret societies aren't even aware of, or...

Or, maybe this is just Enthusiasm. To check if it is, take a step back, take a deep breath, Collect yourself, and then tell me. Was your dream of a Great Maker Revolution That Continuously Evolves More and More Rapidly Into St-Augustine's CITY OF GOD VISION a dream that helped you sleep better at night and DID I CRUSH YOUR DREAMS YET?

These are not dreams, these are dangerous delusions. You're causing people with real problems of this kind a great deal of unnecessary worry that is a grave indignity.

And, besides, THAT IS NEVER GOING TO BE SUSTAINABLE NOT IN A MILLION YEARS merely by the fact that YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING precisely because YOU NEVER DID WHAT WAS NECESSARY TO BECOME-AN-ARTIST. I know this because I continuously gave you the KEYS and you rejected them every time. That was proof that you do not belong to my profession.

You know what else? When I recognize you as one of my Peers, you BECOME-ONE-OF-MY-PEERS, but it can't be just one. It has to be a few of us, and believe me, we are scouring every square inch of this planet for talented Painters to join our Profesion which is in dire need of young, talented Professional Painters. The problem is: The Profession is already infected with too many False Prophets of the Arts & Culture, and almost no one today has what it takes to undertake what is an almost impossible kind of work. Priests and monks have an easier job. You have to be as Humble as St-John or St-Luke or Joseph, Or Better. Or if you want to do Hackjobs, then be my guest. But don't tell me you're an "ARTIST", I will denounce you as a Complete Fraud. That is how you achieve Sustainability in one shot over 50,000 years of Human History.

Gotcha! You would know that already if you were a Professional Painter, and this would have made you laugh. Since it gave you the Antiface Face, the Bitch Face, the Frown, the Face of the World, the Face of Hyper-Solemnity, I could tell you what you were thinking from 100 yards away, because I alone read faces, for I am a Portraitist.

I'm Painting a Digital Portrait of YOU, dear Reader! Isn't It Great? Yes? No? Go check in the mirror. Next time you see Bitch Face in the Mirror or think you are very ugly, think of something funny and keep thinking of ways to make yourself laugh until you succeed. There has to be at least one human possessed with laughter at any given time. But if everyone laughs all the time, we risk losing laughter all in one shot, in one cascade of laughter that ends in Civilization being destroyed. So be careful when you decide to use the limited resource of our very precious Human Laughter. But don't fall into Hyper-Solemnity either for too long.

This has been the Grotesque and Wicked Carnavalesque passed onto us by one Rabelais et al. Professional Finger-Pointers and Presenters of Brothel-Paintings and Stinky Pianos and Publication Barns.
