REFCARDS
========
* Refcards can only ever be used for personal edification, education, cultivation.
* Refcards are designed to help those that would do good in the world, do an even better job.
* Refcards are designed to be illegible to those who have fear in their hearts, and bad intentions in their minds.
* They are true Reference Cards issued based on demand and/or necessity for Refcards.
* Refcards are only legible to those who already have the abstract knowledge (professional) in that they merely reference materials. If one does not already have the materials, called Refmats, then the Refcard issued is perfectly useless.
* In that sense, Refcards are Public Keys to abstract professional knowledge that are perfectly useless to anyone not already working to do good works, to bring a little more beauty and truth and basic goodness into the world.
* Anyone aiming to spread confusion and discord via Refcards, will only penalize themselves.
* Refcards can only ever be used for personal edification, education, and cultivation (cultivation of taste, virtues, etc.)
