Moral Temp Cards
================
In in amateur radio, maritime, aviation and military communications, Brevity codes are used, codes designed to convey complex information with a few words or codes. The moraltempcard is meant to function in a similar manner. It is a Reference Card, a.k.a. Refcard or Quickref, designed to convey complex information specifically about the Moral Temperature or Moral Climate in a particular Time and Place. When one makes a moraltempcard, one is traditionally making it for the current Time & Place. However, being Refcards, moraltempcards can always and forever be expanded upon. In that sense, moraltempcards are a work unit within the greater concept of the Art Project, and/or Art Operation, i.e. The Archives Project, The History Project, Discursive Structures, Articulations, ControlFlow, Strategic Database Arts, etc.
